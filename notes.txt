1. generate a random integer between 1 and 100 (whole numbers)
	-- integer variable 
			--"target"
	is there a funciton for this? 
		YES! math.random()
			random * 100 and add 1
2. user inputs guess
3. new game generates new random number (see 1.)
4. user feedback
	distance between target number and user guess 
	if distance is 0 we found it
	if distance is large then we are cold
	use math.abs() to make sure it is positve even if distance is negative 

5. define -- hot, warm, cold, very cold 
	--if (Math.abs(target-guess) < 10)... etc.
7. keep track of users guesses


**jquery routine to show and hide directions**


take difference of target and guess 

1. Start a new game
2. Generate a random number (the target)
3. Start a loop 
      3a. Ask the user to guess
      3b. Display the guess in the green area
      3c. Display the count of guesses in the Guess #x! area
      3d. Compare guess vs target
      3e. Display the appropriate message in the Red area
end of the loop

Note: If the user clicks "+New Game" at any time, go back to #1 and start all over.
